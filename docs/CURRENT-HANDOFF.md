# Current Handoff

**Last updated:** 2026-09-30

Canonical specifications are in Me+ Google Drive, operational state/checkpoints in Supabase, and implementation/test/release evidence in GitHub. Read source before trusting historical handoffs.

## Health Connect correction and Android 0.3.1

- PR 37 is the release candidate; its GitHub checks and build provenance determine merge readiness. PR 17 collector work is historical and superseded.
- User authorized correction, merge and web publication of the APK.
- Pipeline: Zepp → Health Connect → authenticated Me+ Android collector → backend → Supabase raw revisions and normalized observations.
- Live failures: a 500-reading lookup produced Bad Request; an earlier upload timed out.
- Mobile sends at most 50 readings per request; server caps at 100. Heart-rate raw payloads retain each sample and provider context without duplicating the full sample series.
- Provider revision IDs are SHA-256 digests. Atomic source-serialized ingestion protects freshness, retries and manual corrections.
- Supabase project: wbqnctrvxohxwiaignhg. Both dev and production APIs use this canonical database; branch names do not imply data isolation.
- Android builds must use GitHub Actions on the designated self-hosted Windows runner. Build from a committed SHA, inspect package/version and embedded JS bundle, verify signer compatibility and SHA-256, then stage the versioned APK.
- Netlify hosts web/API and distributes the verified binary; it must never compile Android. Current mobile API target is the dev branch deployment.

## Verification and release

Required before merge: behavioral health tests, atomic SQL acceptance/denied-role checks, workspace typecheck/build, repository policy/security checks, independent review, and successful self-hosted APK build with provenance.

Atomic ingestion migration and live rollback acceptance passed: retries are idempotent, stale revisions cannot overwrite newer records, manual corrections survive, failed batches roll back without advancing last_sync, and anon/authenticated cannot call the server RPC. Runtime CI passed on 866e1d60e9993460b265a5ccc54092377674d7b3. The final merge-candidate SHA must pass all checks and APK verification.

Required before claiming phone sync fixed: install the new APK and perform a live Health Connect upload on the phone; inspect successful canonical sync/observation state and repeat idempotently. A device upload cannot be fabricated from connector access.

Production path: focused fix → dev → approved dev-to-prod PR. Never bypass the production branch or release gate. Rollback web through the last known-good deployed revision; preserve additive history schema. Keep earlier APK versions available.

## Service boundaries

Use native GitHub, Supabase, Google Drive and Netlify connectors for service operations. Desktop Commander is Android-host troubleshooting only. Credentials and sensitive provider payloads stay out of Git and logs.
